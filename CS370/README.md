# CS370 Operating Systems

## :smile: Greetings

Welcome to CS370 Operating Systems! This is a course that will teach you about the fundamentals of operating systems. This course will be taught in C, so you will need to have a basic understanding of C before you start this course. If you do not know C, I recommend you take an introductory course in C and get yourself familiar with the language - particularly pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
